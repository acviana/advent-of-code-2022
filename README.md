### Setup Instructions

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
Once you have installed Poetry you can setup the project by running `poetry install` in the project directory.

A `requirements.txt` file is included if you prefer to set up your own environment with pip or another tool.

### Execution Instructions
pass

### Development Instructions

The Poetry development dependencies are installed by default when you run `poetry install --with=dev`. If you are using pip you can install them from the `requirements_dev.txt` file.

A suggested workflow is documented in the `Makefile`.
